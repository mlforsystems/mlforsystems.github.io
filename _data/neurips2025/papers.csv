However, in lack of a standard, safe, and extensible benchmarking platform, it is difficult to evaluate whether these LLM agents improve real-world system performance and by how much. 
We present InfraGym, an open, extensible platform where researchers can study computer system optimization with LLM agents. 
Our current release includes three real-world cases and supports interaction with both simulated and real environments. We benchmark multiple LLM agents on these tasks using both open-source and closed-source LLMs, and outline future directions. The code is available at \hyperlink{https://github.com/MLSysOps/InfraGym}{https://github.com/MLSysOps/InfraGym}",5

We introduce an online, LLM-driven agent that emulates expert reasoning for continuous OS optimization. 
When tuning the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler’s hyperparameters, the agent outperforms Bayesian optimization by 5\% in single-parameter tuning, 7.1\% in two-parameter co-tuning, and a human expert by 2.98\% overall, while converging faster and adapting more quickly to workload changes. 
When application counters are unavailable, system-level proxies (e.g., Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)) preserved tail latency in our setup.
Putting this together, we propose adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool/resource discovery and invocation and a logging channel; on top of that, we propose adding transactional apply--commit--revert, host-mediated approval gates, and policy controls in the OS-tuning server and host to ensure safe, auditable operation. Our results and reference design suggest a practical path toward safe, self‑adapting OS control.",6
7,Prathamesh Devadiga,Small Language Models as Compiler Experts: Auto-Parallelization for Heterogeneous Systems,"Traditional auto-parallelizing compilers, which depend on rigid heuristics, face challenges with the complexity of modern heterogeneous systems. This paper introduces a detailed evaluation of auto-parallelization driven by small (1B parameter) Language Models (LLMs) for compilers. We assess three models-gemma3, llama3.2, and qwen2.5 employing six reasoning strategies on 11 real-world kernels from scientific computing, graph algorithms, and machine learning. Our system is compared against strong compiler baselines such as LLVM Polly, TVM, and Triton. Across 376 evaluations, our LLM-driven method achieves an average speedup of 6.81x and a maximum performance of 43.25x on convolution operations. We examine scalability, confirm correctness using multiple sanitizers, and validate robustness across various compilers and hardware. Our results show that small, efficient LLMs can act as effective reasoning engines for intricate compiler optimization tasks.",7

While specialized numerical experts, such as those from Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Model Predictive Control (MPC), can be trained to find optimal control policies, their practical deployment is blocked by fundamental systems-level flaws: they are brittle, failing to scale with the system; opaque, preventing operator trust; and rigid, unable to adapt to new runtime objectives.
This paper introduces a novel framework that directly addresses these issues by distilling the policy of a numerical expert into an adaptive LLM agent. Our method transforms the expert's opaque logic into a transparent, interactive, and agentic workflow. To validate this approach, we distill a state-of-the-art RL policy for carbon-aware workload orchestration.
Evaluated in a high-fidelity simulation, our resulting LLM agent demonstrates the capabilities essential for real-world systems deployment. It solves the scalability problem, successfully managing topologies more than three times larger than the expert's training environment. It enables true runtime adaptability, altering its strategy in minutes in response to complex operator commands that would require days of costly retraining for the original expert. By making powerful optimizers manageable and resilient, our work offers a practical pathway to the sustainable control of large-scale computer systems.",8

Shao, Soumyendu Sarkar",ML-Guided Cold Plate Design and Thermal Analysis for Liquid-Cooled HPC Servers,"Efficient thermal management is a major bottleneck in scaling high-performance computing (HPC) systems, where cooling accounts for a substantial share of total energy use. Liquid-cooled cold plates are increasingly adopted in data centers and power electronics, yet their design optimization remains costly due to computationally burdensome computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and high-dimensional geometric spaces. We introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for rapid thermal analysis and design exploration of parameterized cold plates. Our approach jointly solves the incompressible Navier–Stokes and conjugate heat transfer equations, leveraging a two-stage curriculum that first stabilizes liquid flow field learning before introducing thermal coupling. Once trained, the model produces physically consistent predictions and orders-of-magnitude faster inference than conventional CFD solvers. We demonstrate the framework across multiple cold plate topologies, capturing design-dependent flow patterns and thermal gradients that inform geometry–performance trade-offs. These results establish PINNs as a promising surrogate modeling tool for accelerating liquid-cooling design workflows, with implications for reducing the energy and carbon footprint of HPC infrastructure.",9

We present the Agentic Bridge Framework for extracting actionable performance insights from capability evaluations through trace-level telemetry. Applying this framework to a multi-agent system on GAIA validation, we reveal that: (1) pass@N strategies provide diminishing accuracy returns; (2) search agents dominate token usage and latency, identifying web data gathering as the primary bottleneck; (3) reasoning models spend more tokens on context preservation than actual reasoning, highlighting costly inter-agent communication overhead. These findings inform critical design choices—context engineering, tool-use optimization, and phase-aware resource allocation—and illustrate how agent traces can inform reproducible performance workloads, bridging capability achievements with systems optimization for efficient agentic AI.",12

Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference. Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters, Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5$\times$ throughput improvement over metaheuristic baselines and 1.06$\times$ over Megatron heuristics.",13

It handles their specific flavor of System Verilog, and uses a low-latency on-prem fine-tuned model. We outline the process of developing this solution, from data curation, through several stages of model fine-tuning with different contexts, to evaluation and real-time confidence assessment. We then present our results for fine-tuning a 1B-parameter model on ∼1B tokens of in-domain System Verilog code, achieving high semantic fidelity and low latency for both end-of-line and multi-line completions.

Recent methods address this by duplicating popular experts on additional GPUs, requiring accurate prediction of token distributions before routing. This paper examines the tradeoffs between prediction strategy, accuracy, overhead, and system performance. We introduce MoE-GPS, a framework that quantifies these impacts and identifies optimal predictor designs for various system settings.

Learned Count-Min Sketch (LCMS) enhances CMS with a machine learning model to reduce estimation error under the same memory usage, but suffers from slow construction due to empirical parameter tuning and lacks theoretical guarantees on intolerable error probability. 
We propose Optimized Learned Count-Min Sketch (OptLCMS), which partitions the input domain and assigns each partition to its own CMS instance, with CMS parameters $(\epsilon, \delta)$ analytically derived for fixed thresholds, and thresholds optimized via dynamic programming with approximate feasibility checks. This reduces the need for empirical validation, enabling faster construction while providing theoretical guarantees under these assumptions.
OptLCMS also allows explicit control of the allowable error threshold, improving flexibility in practice. 
Experiments show that OptLCMS builds faster, achieves lower intolerable error probability, and matches the estimation accuracy of LCMS.",20

For example, next generation AI accelerators support dot products in MXFP4, a format requiring only 4.25 bits per element. However, accelerator performance for low-precision matrix multiplication far outstrips their performance on reductions and elementwise computations that are still being performed in higher precision. In this work, we reduce the cost of normalisation tensors by approximating the RMSNorm of an MXFP tensor using only the MX block scales, thereby enabling a 32x decrease in the size of reductions needed for normalisation. We validate our approximation on pre-training of Llama-3 models of 250M and 1B parameters, finding minimal loss of training accuracy compared to a baseline using RMSNorm with MXFP8 matmuls.",21

Existing optimization methods, however, rely on time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow development and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{ASAP}$, an $\textbf{A}$gentic $\textbf{S}$olution to $\textbf{A}$uto-optimize $\textbf{P}$erformance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents, which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools, roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated sharding configurations can contribute up to 28\% training step time reduction and 1.43$\times$ throughput improvement. When combined with additional optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58$\times$.

Awad, Ryan Swann, Jeffrey Jian Ma, Keith Lowery, Vijay Janapa Reddi",SwizzlePerf: Hardware-Aware LLMs for GPU Kernel Performance Optimization,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization - hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving LLMs explicit hardware-awareness. 

For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels, SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM performance engineering agents.",23
24,"Kshitij Bhardwaj, Torrey Wagner, Edgar A. Leon",Leveraging Large Language Models to Enhance Machine-Learning-Driven HPC Job Scheduling,"High-performance computing (HPC) systems rely on job schedulers like Slurm to
allocate compute resources to submitted workloads. Recently, machine learning
models have been used to predict job runtimes which can be used by schedulers
to optimize utilization. However, many of these models struggle to effectively
encode string-type job features, typically relying on integer-based Label or One-hot
encoding methods. In this paper, we use Transformer-based large language models,
particularly Sentence-BERT (SBERT), to semantically encode job features for
regression-based job runtime prediction. Using a 90,000-record 169-feature Slurm
dataset we evaluate four SBERT variants and compare them against traditional
encodings using four regression models. Our results show that SBERT-based
encodings—especially using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model—substantially outperform
conventional methods, achieving an r2 score up to 0.88; 2.3× higher than
traditionally-used Label encoding. Moreover, we highlight practical trade-offs,

While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks (e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration), time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25% detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an executed trajectory from 12% to 8%.

standard semantic retrieval on the explanations, (ii) GraphRAG over code and
(iii) GraphRAG over the explanations. On a corpus of ∼3.5K files and a bench-

This study proposes an experimental framework and comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the efficiency of data deletion for ANNS indexes under practical use cases.
Specifically, we categorize data deletion methods in graph-based ANNS into three approaches and formalize them mathematically. 
The performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, query speed, and other relevant metrics.

Our evaluation on vision tasks showed that NeuSym-HLS reduces hardware resource usage, reduces latency, while maintaining model inference accuracy.",51

Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: ""Can we surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the ContextRot effects?"" In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards other relevant long-context tasks.",54
55,"Samuel Yuan, Divyanshu Saxena, Jiayi Chen, Nihal Sharma, Aditya Akella",A Joint Learning Approach to Hardware Caching and Prefetching,"Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems.
By leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution.
However, policies trained in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together.
In this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching -- for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching.
We argue that these two policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the two \textit{jointly}. 
We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared representations for the features used by the two policies.
We present two approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these.
Finally, we lay down an agenda for future research in this direction.",55

While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.",56

The task boils down to selecting the optimal number of nodes for a given job. We present a surrogate-assisted multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to automate this complex decision. Our core hypothesis is that surrogate models informed by attention-based embeddings of job telemetry can capture performance dynamics more effectively than standard regression techniques. We pair this with an intelligent sample acquisition strategy to ensure the approach is data-efficient. On two production HPC datasets, our embedding-informed method consistently identified higher-quality Pareto fronts of runtime-power trade-offs compared to baselines. Furthermore, our intelligent data sampling strategy drastically reduced training costs while improving the stability of the results. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply embedding-informed surrogates in a MOBO framework to the HPC scheduling problem, jointly optimizing for performance and power on production workloads.",63

However, for specialized domains such as program synthesis, the relative scarcity of HDL and proprietary EDA resources online compared to more common programming tasks introduces challenges, often necessitating task-specific fine-tuning, high inference costs, and manually-crafted agent orchestration. In this work, we present VeriMaAS, a multi-agent framework designed to automatically compose agentic workflows for RTL code generation. Our key insight is to integrate formal verification feedback from HDL tools directly into workflow generation, reducing the cost of gradient-based updates or prolonged reasoning traces. Our method improves synthesis performance by 5–7% for pass@k over fine-tuned baselines, while requiring only a few hundred ""training"" examples, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction in supervision cost.",64

Yet LLM deployments are energy-intensive, as inference accounts for over 90% of the model lifecycle in cloud workloads. We show that RAG workflows with near-identical accuracy can differ drastically in energy consumption—a property we call “workflow fungibility.” For example, pairing Llama3-8B with stronger retrievers matches the accuracy of Llama3-70B while using over 5× less energy. To study this effect, we profile retrieval and generation configurations across FinanceBench and FRAMES, mapping the joint accuracy–energy landscape. Our results reveal configurations within ≤3% accuracy that differ by up to 20.2× in energy, exposing large hidden opportunities for efficiency. We further demonstrate that lightweight regressors can predict accuracy from a small set of configuration knobs, enabling prediction-guided pruning of the design space. These findings establish workflow fungibility as a key lever for sustainable RAG, and point toward systematic, energy-aware configuration as a critical direction for retrieval-based LLM systems.",65

Enabling fractional sharing of the inference engine requires a real-time, per-request attribution primitive that is accurate and light enough to run inside the scheduling loop. We present LLMVisor, a roofline-guided latency attribution model that captures the memory-bound and compute-bound phases via a concise piecewise-linear form over features proportional to FLOPs and memory I/O traffic. LLMVisor decomposes batch latency into additive, per-request shares and runs efficiently at microsecond (µs) scale. We evaluate LLMVisor across Llama3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-14B/32B on A100/H100 under varying tensor parallelism and workload mixes. Compared to a token-count baseline, LLMVisor attains near-perfect R² and reduces relative error by up to 2.5×/3.3× (p90/p99) for prefill and 3.5×/4.4× for decode, despite batching variability and sequence divergence.",67

  On Qwen3 and LLaMA-3.1, QAQ matches the accuracy of 8-bit baselines while reducing GPU memory footprint, with an associated latency overhead.

To address this, DataSwift is introduced, a hint-recommendation framework that integrates LLM-derived SQL embeddings, GNN-encoded plan representations, a similarity-threshold memory cache, and Thompson-sampling bandit exploration. Incoming queries are embedded to recall proven hints; a low-rank inductive matrix completion model predicts expected latency. Validated hints are cached and the bandit down-weights any hints inducing slowdowns. On the combined JOB benchmarks, DataSwift incurs only a 0.7% regression rate with zero catastrophic regressions and delivers a 1.4x improvement on the 5% slowest queries. Thus, DataSwift provides performance gains without sacrificing safety.",69
