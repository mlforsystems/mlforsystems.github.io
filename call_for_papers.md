        <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning for Systems is an annual, interdisciplinary workshop that brings together researchers and practitioners in computer systems and machine learning, specifically focusing on the novel application of machine learning techniques towards computer systems problems.</p>
        <h2>Important Dates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Submission Deadline: <b><s>August 22, 2025</s> August 29, 2025 by midnight (Anywhere in the World)</b>.</li>
                <li>Acceptance Notifications: September 22, 2025</li>
                <li>Workshop: December 6, 2025</li></ul>
        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>We invite submission of up to <b>4-page</b> extended abstracts in the broad area of <b>using machine learning in the design and management of computer systems </b>.
        We are especially interested in submissions that move beyond using machine learning to replace numerical heuristics. </p>
        <p>This year, we additionally look for
            <ul>
                <li>Using <b> LLMs and agentic workflows for computer systems challenges</b>, such as program synthesis for hardware, adaptive runtime optimization, and other specialized domains.</li>
                <li>Applying <b>ML to address emerging systems challenges introduced by agentic workflows, large-scale training and serving of large models</b>, including LLMs and multimodal models — such as compiler partitioning strategies for distributed training, efficient memory and compute allocation, workflow orchestration, and automated infrastructure management across heterogeneous accelerators.</li>
                <li>Applying <b>ML for compute sustainability</b>, including power/energy/carbon optimization. Examples include energy-aware job scheduling, dynamic power management based on workload and carbon predictions, and ML-driven carbon footprint assessment for cloud datacenters.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Accepted papers will be optionally linked on the workshop website, but there will be no formal proceedings. Authors may therefore publish their work in other journals or conferences. The workshop will include invited talks from industry and academia, as well as oral and poster presentations by workshop participants.</p>
         <p>
