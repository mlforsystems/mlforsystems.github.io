					<h4>Chris Lattner (Modular.ai)</h4>
					<p>
                        Chris is the co-founder and CEO of Modular AI. He cofounded the LLVM Compiler infrastructure, the Clang compiler, the Swift programming language, the MLIR compiler infrastructure, the CIRCT project (applying MLIR to hardware design), and have contributed to many other commercial and open source projects at Apple, Tesla, Google, and SiFive. Previously, Chris led the Engineering and Product teams at SiFive, the Google TensorFlow team, the Tesla Autopilot team, and worked for Apple managing the Developer Tools department.

					<h4>Srivatsan Krishnan (Harvard University)</h4>
					<p>Srivatsan is a final year PhD candidate at Harvard University. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer architecture, machine learning, and robotics. In particular, his research focuses on creating scalable ML-driven methodologies for automating design of computer systems. Prior to starting his PhD, he was the technical lead in Intel Xeon with an integrated FPGA team for building tightly-coupled hardware accelerator IPs for machine learning/deep learning applications. His work was awarded Best Paper of IEEE Computer Architecture Letters in 2020, and IEEE Micro Top Picks 2023 Honorable Mention.
